<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>Movie that made me like action films. Keanu Reeves really did an incredible job playing as John Wick.</p>
<h3>Ballerina</h3>
<p>A movie about sweet revenge. I like this since it has satisfying ending, and proper closure.</p>
<h3>From Up On Poppy Hill</h3>
<p>A feel good studio ghibli movie about coming of age, and romance.</p>
